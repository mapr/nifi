@CapabilityDescription("Consumes messages from EEP Kafka specifically built against the EEP Kafka 3.0 Consumer API. "
        + "The complementary NiFi processor for sending messages is PublishKafkaRecord_EEP_3. Please note that, at this time, the Processor assumes that "
        + "all records that are retrieved from a given partition have the same schema. If any of the Kafka messages are pulled but cannot be parsed or written with the "
        + "configured Record Reader or Record Writer, the contents of the message will be written to a separate FlowFile, and that FlowFile will be transferred to the "
        + "'parse.failure' relationship. Otherwise, each FlowFile is sent to the 'success' relationship and may contain many individual messages within the single FlowFile. "
        + "A 'record.count' attribute is added to indicate how many messages are contained in the FlowFile. No two Kafka messages will be placed into the same FlowFile if they "
        + "have different schemas, or if they have different values for a message header that is included by the <Headers to Add as Attributes> property.")
